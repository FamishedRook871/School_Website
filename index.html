<p>History Bowl is a fun thing to do where you compete in History questions. Ms. Boles Provides a fun place to show off what you know about human history. You can have fun in this activiy or class and enjoy yourself. There are many smart kids such as Tarun, Dakshesh, Sam, and Jonathan. We all are pretty smart and I am proud to be a part of this group.(The photo was after a tournament we had which both of our teams made nationals. Bethel Middle A and B. I was part of Bethel Middle B.) Thanks Ms. Boles for providing a fun learning environment. She also runs geography bee which only one kid won every year. Akhil. But yeah thats basically what History Bowl is.</p> </div>
